# blgo-builder

### Motivation

I wanted to have a personal blog and thought tools like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) have too many features that I don't actually need.

I once found [blgo](https://github.com/siadat/blgo) and decided to rearchitect the code to make it more clean. This allows me to customize it and add more features to it easier.
